# Json Graph Visualizer

## Introduction

- A simple visualizer for displaying the json in a visually appealing way.
- The application takes the json through the editor.
- The json is parsed and rendered to display the json as network graph.

## Used Packages

- [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) : A modern alternative to CSS resets
- [@amcharts/amcharts4](https://www.amcharts.com/) : For displaying the network graph.
- [material-ui/core](https://material-ui.com/) : For building UI components with material styles.

## Open Issues

- Graph needs to changes, not suitable for big json.

## Future Scopes

- An simple fetch api can be integrated to simply get request for json from any api endpoints.
